// your mission, should you choose to accept it is to:
// - create a new class, call it Car
// - make sure it has a constructor function that takes 3 arguments
//    - Make
//    - Model
//    - Year
// - Car should implement a drive function, that echos out "Car is driving!"
// - create another class that extends Car called MyCar
//    - It should use a constructor function and call to the parent::_construct class
//    - It's constructor should also take one argument, an array (associative array to be exact)
//    - Using that associative array, loop it's values and set them as properties of the class
//    - It should implement a details function that will echo out the make, model, and year.
// - Create an instance of the class
// - Call the drive function
// - Call the details function
